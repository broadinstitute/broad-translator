# broad-translator
Component of the Broad-based gray team to the NCATS Biomedical translator.

This is an SBT/Scala/Play project.

## How to run
In SBT, simply say "run".

Currently, there is a test page on http://localhost:9000, inherited from the seed template.

## How to edit
IntelliJ IDEA can import this as-is as an SBT project, if you have the IntelliJ Scala plugin.

I don't know if Eclipse can, too, but there is an Eclipse plugin for SBT which can export this to Eclipse.
